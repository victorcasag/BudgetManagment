<h1><a name="limitation">Other important points</a></h1>

<h2>[General Issue]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Banner pages cannot be printed using the source tray that is selected to print "Chapter Page". Please use another source tray to print banner pages.
<li> If you are printing a letter size file in Microsoft Office Word 2010 and printed on A4 size.In that case, uncheck [Options] - [Advanced options] - [Print]-[Scale content for A4 or 8.5 x 11" paper sizes] from the menu in Word.
<li>If odd-paged document is printed as the following setting at Adobe Reader X, an extra page might be added and the added page might be incremented in the printer's counter. 
<DL>
<DT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application settings:
<DD>Copies : 2 or more
<DD>Collate : Not Off
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver settings:
<DD>Duplex : Not Off
</DL>
If application's copies is 1 and driver's copies is 2 or more, extra page is not added.
<li>In the environment to which the computer name is set by 16 bytes or more, the host name with banner page print is printed only up to 15 bytes. 
<li>In the case of specific application, only one part will be printed even if the combination of post-processing features and number of copies by from the driver set of multiple.
Post-processing capability refers to the following items.
<ul>
<li>Staple
<li>Punch
<li>Fold
<li>Sort
<li>Perfect Binding etc.<br>
The example of specific application : Microsoft Office Project, Microsoft Office Visio
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>[OS/Windows Related Issues]</h2>

<ul>
<li>The driver's "Web Image Monitor" button might not work in an IPv6 environment. 
</ul>
<h2>[Driver Setting Related Issues]</h2>

<ul>
<li>The use of Reverse Order is not supported with the Duplex, Front Cover, Back Cover, Chapter Pages, Slip Sheet functions.
<li>In the case of specific application, may not print number of copies that set by the driver.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Avoidance]Set number of copies by applications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example of specific application :
<ul>
<li>Adobe Reader X
<li>Adobe Acrobat X
<li>Adobe Illustrator CS5
<li>Adobe InDesign CS5
<li>Adobe InDesign CS5.5
</ul>
<li>If the Staple setting is "2 at Center" or if the "Reverse Order"setting is On, the driver will add an extra page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page will be incremented in the printer's counter. There is no way to prevent this.
</ul>
<h2>[Printing Issues]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Additional Page Count in Duplex Printing. An extra page is added to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page might be incremented in the printer's counter.
<li>Thin lines printed at high resultion (1200dpix1200dpi) might be difficult to see in the printed output. In such cases, use of a lower resolution is recommended.
<li>Inconsistencies during the cross pattern in raster mode to print specific data.<br>
In this case, set the vector mode.
<li>Depending on the combination of text and font settings for watermark, text might not be printed.<br>
In such case, a change of font is recommended.
</ul>
<h2>[B/W print with CMYK setting Issue]</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the "Color/ Black and White" setting  is "Color" some purely BW objects might be printed using CMYK toners (composite black). If the "Color/ Black and White" setting = "Black and White", all objects will be printed using K toner (pure black) only.
</ul>
